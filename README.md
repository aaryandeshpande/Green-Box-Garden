This program runs on an arduino microcontroller that controls our custom miniature garden. Our project focused the development of a system with various points of automation to reduce external involvement in agricultural environments. Using our microcontroller, alongside a soil-moisture sensor and a photoresistor, this program was used to create self-regulated irrigation and lighting systems. Our team used sensor feedback and digital signal control to monitor moisture levels in 15-minute intervals, and employed a mapping function to create a responsive lighting system with analog signal control. We also implemented the millis() function to create an 18-hour lighting and 6-hour darkness period, simulating real world conditions.
